This project contains three examples written in the Go programming language.

1. **`sortByCharacterCount`**
   - Sorts the given words in descending order based on the count of the letter "a."
   - Usage: `sortByCharacterCount(words []string) []string`

2. **`recursiveFunction`**
   - Takes an integer as input, divides it by two at each step, and then prints the result.
   - Usage: `recursiveFunction(n int)`

3. **`findMostRepeated`**
   - Finds the most repeated element and its count in a given array.
   - Usage: `findMostRepeated(data []string) (string, int)`
